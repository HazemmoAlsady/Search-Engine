# Ranked Search Engine (Information Retrieval Project)

This project implements a **mini ranked search engine** based on core
Information Retrieval concepts studied in the course.

The system supports:
- Document ingestion
- Text preprocessing
- Ranked retrieval using TF-IDF
- Cosine similarity for scoring documents

The project is implemented and executed using **Google Colab**.
